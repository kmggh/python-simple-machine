"""The second program that counts down from 10.x

The count will be in the accumulator.  This program displays
the address executed and also the current accumulator value
on each fetch-execute cycle.

We store a value of -1 into a memory location and then add that
location to the accumulator to decrement the value.

Also the just-added skip on zero is used to skip the jump to the
start of the loop address when the accumulator reaches zero.
